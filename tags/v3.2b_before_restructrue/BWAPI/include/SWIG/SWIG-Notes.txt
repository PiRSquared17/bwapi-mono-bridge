I added to shape.h, command.h default constructors (bwapi\client)
  eg (	Shape() {}; and Command() {};)

and added the implementation for the default constructor in bwapi\client\gamedata.h


eg
} //end struct

 GameData::GameData(void) {
  }

This was because the version I had included an unimplemented default constructor for gamedata which needs a default implementation for shape and command
if it is ever used, but swig will generate code for this function because EVERYTHING is used in swig. so I just fixed it up.
