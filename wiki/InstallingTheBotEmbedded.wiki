#summary Install Instructions for the Embedded mono bridge bot

= Introduction =

This is a quick walkthrough of installing the bwapi-mono-bridge skeleton AI in embedded mode (running in the same process as starcraft). 


= Details =

  # Follow all directions for obtaining and setting up the BWAPI 3.2 [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/UsingBWAPI]
  # Download the zip file from the downloads tab
  # Extract the zip to a new folder
  # copy the contents of the examplebots\embeddedbot folder into the bwapi-data\AI folder in your starcraft directory (created during BWAPI setup)
  # Edit the bwapi.ini file and change the ai_dll line to read:
{{{
[ai]
ai_dll = bwapi-data\AI\MonoBridge.dll
}}}
  # Make sure mono 2.8 or above is installed on your computer www.go-mono.com
  # set an environment variable called "MonoPath" with its value being the path to the Mono's bin folder eg "C:\program files\Mono-2.8\bin" (Hint right click my computer->properties->advanced->environment variables->add)

You are ready to run the bot. Just run chaoslauncher as per usual and the bot should see a message from the bot when it starts up. (if it isn't working then broodwar will crash, try checking log file to see the problem)
