This is a walkthrough on how to modify the hello world bot included in the download. Some extra steps are required so that this bot will not need .NET or Mono installed on the machine on which it will run. (Tested on a vanilla xp sp3)


= Details =
 # Follow the instructions from InstallingTheBot to get the hello bot up and running

 # Make sure you have Mono installed www.mono-project.com/download (You can still use .net to compile your bot, mono is used for its libraries in the deployment phase)

 # Download and extract the zip file from the downloads tab
 # In the StarcraftBot\Source directory there is a solution called monobridgeai.sln. This solution contains all 3 subprojects needed to run the bot.
   * MonoBridgeAI - Called from C++ to load and run the bot. 
   * MonoBridgeAI-Interop - Contains the automatic and user generated class files for talking to BWAPI.dll. 
   * StarcraftBot - This is where the magic happens. Extend this to code your bot.
 # Open the solution file (I have tested Sharpdevelop 3+, Visual Studio 2008, Monodevelop 2.2)
 # Make your changes. (You will mainly be editing the StarcraftBot project within the solution. You can also extend any of the BWAPI generated classes in the monobridgeai-interop project by adding a partial class to the user-classes folder (see the example in the project)
 # To build the bot just build the solution.

You should now have your assemblies that make up your bot. What we need to do now is to copy them and their required .NET runtime classes to the bot folder. To do this easily we can take the following steps:
  # First setup access to the mono runtime (only needs to be done once)
    # If you havent already, ensure you have downloaded and installed mono-2.6.1 from [url]www.go-mono.com[/url]
    # Copy the lib and etc folders from your mono install and paste them into the bwapi-data\ai\mono folder 
  # Replace the files in your starcraft\bwapi\ai\bot folder with those from your project output (bin\debug) folder. Make sure that monobridgeai.dll is included.
  # you can now run your bot the usual way from chaoslauncher. 
  # To give your bot to someone else, just zip up the bwapi-data folder (warning: this can get very big) People running your bot will not need the .net or mono runtimes installed as they are embedded as part of your bot(helping meet the requirements of the Starcraft AI Competition)
