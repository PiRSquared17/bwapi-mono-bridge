#summary Install Instructions for the BWAPIClient based bot

= Introduction =

{{{
With BWAPI 2.8 and up, it is now possible to run a bot as a separate process which can still use BWAPI.
This is done with shared memory and must be run on the same computer as starcraft.
bwapi-mono-bridge is also compatible with this method.
}}}

This is a quick guide to setting up the BWAPIClient based bot.

= Details =

  # Follow all directions for obtaining and setting up the BWAPI 3.5.4 [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/UsingBWAPI]
  # Download the zip file from the downloads tab
  # Extract the zip to a new folder
  # open the StarcraftBot solution from the starcraftbot folder with vs 2008 sp1
  # edit the references of the starcraftbot project and remove bwapi-clr.dll and starcraftbotlib.dll
  # add references to starcraftbotlib.dll and bwapi-clr.dll from the libs\client folder
  # compile the project
  # Copy everything from the libs\client folder and place them into bwapi-data\ai in your starcraft folder. (this is not essential, the bot can be run from anywhere on your system, as long as the required files are in the same place)
  # copy starcraftbot.dll from your project bin folder to the bwapi-data\AI folder

=Running the Bot=
To run the bot:
  # launch the ClrAiModuleLoader by running ClrAiModuleLoader.exe (it should say connecting...)
  # launch starcraft on the same computer (the bot should now say "waiting for match")
  # start a custom match against the computer.
  # the bot should print some stuff to the screen etc.
