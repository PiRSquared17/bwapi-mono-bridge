  # Follow all directions for obtaining and setting up the BWAPI 2.6.1 [http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/UsingBWAPI]
  # Download the zip file from the downloads tab
  # Extract the zip to a new folder
  # copy the contents of the StarcraftBot\bwapi-data\AI folder into the bwapi-data\AI folder in your starcraft directory (created during BWAPI setup)
  # Edit the bwapi.ini file and change the ai_dll line to read:
{{{
[ai]
ai_dll = bwapi-data\AI\MonoBridge.dll
}}}
  # You are ready to run the bot. Just run chaoslauncher as per usual and the .net bot should say hello from mono/CLR when it starts up.
